        <h2 align="center" >Here are some of my thoughts about creating this logo design:</h2>
        <hr width="60%">
        <ul align="center" >
            <li>i created this logo in Adobe Illustrator. I primarily used the pen tool and the direct selection tool to modity points. also used the rectangle shape tool.</li>
            <li>chose to use an analogous color scheme for this logo. I chose the colors blue, teat, and green. These coiors remind me of water and fit well with the whale icor.</li>
            <li>I feel this logo appeals to the target audience for several reasons. The hame ot the business, Whale Design Studio, has a quirky sort of feel. The whale icon fits with this quirky kind of vibe, and it has a hapy tittle smile that seers inviting I also feel that the banner shape behind 
                the whate icon is aesthetically pleasing and a litte different from other design logos that i have seen. Overal, it gives the kind of feeling that I would personally be drawn to ifi were looking for design services.</li>
            <li>This logo incorporates the following design skills: tastefut typagraphy, asymmetry, and colar theory. This logo uses tasteful typography in the font chaice and the way the fonts contrast with each other. The design is asymmetrical, which adds visual interest, while stil remaining balanced.
                The colors used work well with the whale icon while still creating contrast.</li>
        </ul>
